Welcome to TFFM's documentation!
================================

We provide here the documentation of the TFFM-framework developed in `Python
<http://docs.python.org/2.7/>`_.  The **Transcription Factor Flexible Models
(TFFMs)** represent TFBSs and are based on hidden Markov models (HMM). They are
flexible and are able to model both position interdependence within TFBSs and
variable length motifs within a single dedicated framework.

The framework also implements methods to generate a new graphical
representation of the modeled motifs that convey properties of position
interdependences.

TFFMs have been assessed on ChIP-seq data sets coming from the `ENCODE project
<http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/>`_, revealing that the new HMM-based framework
performs, in most cases, better than both PWMs and the dinucleotide weight
matrix (DWM) extension in discriminating motifs within ChIP-seq sequences from
background sequences. Under the assumption that ChIP-seq signal values are
correlated with the affinity of the TF-DNA binding, we find that TFFM scores
correlate with ChIP-seq peak signals. Moreover, using available TF-DNA affinity
measurements for the Max TF, we observe that TFFMs constructed from ChIP-seq
data correlate with published experimentally measured DNA-binding affinities.
These results demonstrate the capacity of TFFMs to accurately model DNA-protein
interactions, while providing a single unified framework suitable for the next
generation of TFBS predictions. All the details have been published in
**Mathelier and Wasserman, The Next Generation of Transcription Binding Site
Prediction,** *PLOS Computational Biology* , Sept. 2013, 9(9):e1003214,
`DOI:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003214 <http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1003214>`_.


TFFMs can be saved and opened from files using the XML format already used by
the `GHMM library <http://ghmm.org>`_.

System requirements
===================

* The TFFM-framework 2.0 has been developed and tested under `Ubuntu Linux
  <http://www.ubuntu.com/>`_ operating system. It has also been tested on
  `CentOS <http://www.centos.org>`_.
* **Python** should be installed (version 2.7 has been used
  successfully).
* **Biopython** (at least version 1.61) should be installed and accessible from
  your Python executable. See http://biopython.org for instructions on how to
  install it.
* The **GHMM** library should be installed and accessible from Python. See
  http://ghmm.org for instructions on how to install it.

Installation using conda and launching the tutorial
===================================================

First, install `conda and bioconda
<https://bioconda.github.io/user/install.html>`_ using the instructions::

    conda create --name tffm1 python=2.7 biopython=1.70 ghmm

This will require agreeing to install many packages, and takes a minute or two.

Activate the conda environment::

    conda activate tffm

Download TFFM as a git repository::

    git clone https://github.com/wassermanlab/TFFM.git

Change to tutorial directory and launch python::

    cd TFFM/tutorial
    python

Tutorial
========

Data for this tutorial can be found in the tutorial directory of the
TFFM-framework package at
https://github.com/wassermanlab/TFFM/tree/master/tutorial. To run this example,
you need to be located in the tutorial directory. The location to be added to
`sys.path` (second line of the tutorial) corresponds to the directory
containing the TFFM-framework.

>>> import sys
>>> sys.path.append(<TFFM-framework repository path>)
>>> import tffm_module
>>> from constants import TFFM_KIND
>>> 
>>> tffm_first_order = tffm_module.tffm_from_meme("meme.txt", TFFM_KIND.FIRST_ORDER)
